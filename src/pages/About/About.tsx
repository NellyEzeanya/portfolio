      <p>
        I'm Nelly Ezeanya, a beginner front-end web developer and designer based
        in Nigeria. Although I've only been building things on the web for 2
        years, I take a professional approach to my work and strive to create
        engaging, accessible, and performant interfaces for humans. <br />{" "}
        <br /> My toolkit includes technologies like Javascript, React, and
        more, and I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to improve my
        skills. While I may be a beginner, I'm committed to meeting the highest
        standards and delivering top-notch work for my clients.
